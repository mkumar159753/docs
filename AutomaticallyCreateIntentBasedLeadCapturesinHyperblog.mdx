## Hyperblog – World's First CMS with AI-powered, intent-driven lead generation.

Hyperblog takes lead generation to the next level by automatically detecting user intent and embedding smart lead capture components directly within your blog posts. No third-party integrations or manual setup required — it’s all built in.

## What is Intent-Based Lead Capture?

Instead of placing generic lead forms everywhere, Hyperblog analyzes the **topic, tone, and purpose** of your content using AI. Based on this understanding, it auto-generates a **highly relevant lead magnet** (like eBooks, templates, guides, or checklists) and places it in the most impactful position within the blog post.

## How to Use It

1. **Create or Edit a Blog Post**
   - Write your content or paste it into the editor.
2. **Click “Enhanced Blog”**
   - This triggers Hyperblog’s AI engine to analyze the post content.
3. **Automatic Insertion**
   - If the content is suitable for lead generation, a contextual lead capture block is generated and inserted automatically. It may include:
     - A custom lead magnet offer
     - Email form (optional with validation)
     - CTA button
     - Inline visuals based on theme branding
4. **Customize (Optional)**

   After generation, you can:
   - Edit the CTA text and lead magnet description.
   - Move or delete the block.
   - Change form fields (e.g., Name, Email).
5. **Publish**
   - Once satisfied, click **Publish** or **Schedule** your post. The lead form will be live and ready to capture user data.
