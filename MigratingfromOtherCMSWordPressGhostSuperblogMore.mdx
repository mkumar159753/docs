HyperBlog makes it incredibly simple to move your entire content library from your current CMS — whether you're using **WordPress**, **Ghost**, **Superblog**, **Wix**, or any other platform. Whether you have **100 posts or 100,000**, HyperBlog handles large-scale imports smoothly, including metadata and SEO details.

## How to Migrate Your Blog to HyperBlog

1. **Go to your HyperBlog dashboard.**
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Import**.
3. You'll see a list of supported CMS platforms:
   - WordPress
   - Ghost
   - Superblog
   - Wix
   - Notion
   - Feather.so
   - and more

Choose your CMS to begin the import process.

## Migrating from WordPress (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1 – Export from WordPress

1. Log in to your WordPress Admin.
2. Go to **Tools → Export**.
3. Choose the **“Posts”** option.
4. Apply filters if needed:
   - Categories
   - Authors
   - Date Range (Start/End)
   - Post Status (Published, Draft, etc.)
5. Click **Download Export File** — this will save an .xml file to your computer.

### Step 2 – Import into HyperBlog

1. Go to **HyperBlog Settings → Import**.
2. Click on **WordPress**.
3. Upload your .xml file and start the import.
4. Once done, go to the **Blog** section — you’ll see all your posts successfully imported.

Note: If you’ve used SEO plugins like **RankMath** or **Yoast**, your SEO metadata (titles, descriptions, focus keywords) are also imported automatically.

## What About Ghost, Superblog, Wix, etc.?

The import process is **similar** across other CMS platforms:

- Go to your platform’s export section (e.g., Ghost Admin → Labs → Export).
- Download the export file (usually .json or .xml).
- In HyperBlog, go to **Settings → Import**, choose your platform, and upload the file.

HyperBlog will intelligently parse and import your blog posts, metadata, and categories wherever supported.

**What’s Imported?** 

- Blog Post Titles & Content
- Categories & Tags
- Featured Images (where supported)
- SEO Metadata (if available in the export)
- Post Dates and Status (published/draft)

HyperBlog removes the headache from content migration. With just a few clicks, you can import thousands of blog posts from any major CMS and start optimizing them with HyperBlog’s AI-powered SEO tools. No need for technical support or plugins — it’s fast, reliable, and designed for scale.
