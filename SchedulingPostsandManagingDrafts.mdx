## Managing Drafts

No need to worry about saving your work manually. Hyperblog automatically saves your blog post as a **draft** as you write.

- Any blog post you start creating will be stored as a draft until you choose to publish or schedule it.
- You can return to your drafts anytime from the **Blogs** section of the dashboard.

Draft status is clearly shown next to each blog post so you always know what’s ready and what’s still in progress.
