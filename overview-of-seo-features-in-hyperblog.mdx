### Some of the SEO ranking factors it checks:

- Keyword in title, meta, intro, alt tags
- Word count (ideal: 2,000–5,000)
- Keyword density (1–2%)
- Internal & external links
- Use of subheadings, bullets, short paragraphs
- Featured image and infographics
- FAQ schema, polls, banner presence
- Lead magnet inclusion
- Table of contents

Each issue comes with a **“Create Using AI”** button, so you can generate missing elements instantly no need to write them manually.

These checks help you optimize **each post** for better visibility and ranking on Google.

## Core Web Vitals Built In

HyperBlog is built on **Next.js**, one of the fastest and most SEO-friendly frameworks recommended by Google. That means:

- No need for caching plugins
- No need for extra performance optimization tools
- Fast loading even for long-form, media-heavy content

HyperBlog handles all the performance optimization for you — automatically passing Core Web Vitals like **LCP, CLS, FID**, and **INP** out of the box. This speed not only improves user experience but also significantly boosts your SEO performance.

Go to **Settings → SEO Settings** to manage:
