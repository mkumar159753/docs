### Some of the SEO ranking factors it checks:

- Use of subheadings, bullets, short paragraphs

Each issue comes with a **“Create Using AI”** button, so you can generate missing elements instantly no need to write them manually.

These checks help you optimize **each post** for better visibility and ranking on Google.
