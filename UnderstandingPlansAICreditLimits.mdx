## Upgrading and Downgrading

HyperBlog makes it easy to manage your subscription:

### Upgrading Your Plan

To upgrade your current HyperBlog subscription to a higher-tier plan:

**Steps:**

1. Go to **Settings â†’ Upgrade Plan**
2. Choose the plan you want to upgrade to
3. Review the cost adjustment based on your current usage
4. Confirm upgrade changes take effect immediately

**Billing Logic for Upgrade (Prorated)**

If youâ€™ve already paid for a full year on a lower plan, weâ€™ll only charge you for the **remaining months** based on the new planâ€™s pricing.

#### **Example:**

**Youâ€™re on the Launch monthly plan:**

- Paid: \$25/month
-  Used: 15 days (half of the billing cycle)
-  Remaining value: \$12.50

You want to upgrade to the Grow monthly plan:

- Grow Plan: \$45/month
-  Remaining 15 days cost = (\$45 Ã· 30) Ã— 15 = \$22.50
- You already have \$12.50 in balance

 ðŸ‘‰ You only pay the difference:\
 \$22.50 â€“ \$12.50 = \$10

The upgrade happens instantly, and your billing is adjusted fairly.

**You're on the Launch yearly plan:**

- Paid: \$264/year
- Used: 4 months = \$88 (1/3rd of the year)
- Remaining value: \$176

You want to upgrade to the Grow yearly plan:

- Grow Yearly Plan: \$475/year
- Remaining 8 months cost = (\$475 Ã· 12) Ã— 8 = \$316.66
- You already have \$176 in balance

ðŸ‘‰ You only pay the difference:\
 \$316.66 â€“ \$176 = \$140.66

## **Downgrading Your Plan**

To downgrade your plan:

### **Steps:**

1. Go to **Settings â†’ Upgrade Plan**
2. Select a lower-tier plan
3. Confirm downgrade â€” it will take effect **after your current billing cycle ends**

### **Billing Logic for Downgrade**

When you downgrade:

- Your current plan will **remain active until the end of your paid billing period** (monthly or yearly)
- Downgrade will apply **only from the next billing cycle**
- No refunds are processed for mid-cycle downgrades, but your new plan will be billed at the updated rate from the next cycle

#### **Example:**

**Youâ€™re on the Grow monthly plan:**

- **Paid**: \$45/month
-  **Used**: 15 days (half of the billing cycle)
-  **Remaining value**: \$22.50

You want to switch to the **Launch monthly plan** (\$25/month):\
 ðŸ‘‰ But since youâ€™ve already paid for Grow, your **current plan continues** until the end of the billing cycle.

After that:

- Your subscription automatically renews at **Launch plan rate**: \$25/month
- You wonâ€™t be charged the higher amount again

**No refunds are issued** for the downgrade mid-cycle.\
**No extra steps** needed after choosing the lower-tier plan, HyperBlog will handle the switch on the next billing date.

**You're on the Grow yearly plan (\$475/year)**

- You want to downgrade to **Launch yearly plan (\$264/year)**

You will continue using Grow features until the year ends\
At renewal, you'll only be charged \$264 for Launch

### Switching Between Monthly and Yearly Plans

You can upgrade or downgrade your HyperBlog subscription at any time whether you're moving from **monthly to yearly**, or from **yearly to monthly**.

We follow a **fair billing system**:

- When you switch plans, the **unused value from your current subscription** is automatically **adjusted toward your new plan**.
- You **only pay the difference** based on what's remaining.
- This ensures that you're billed fairly, no overcharges or surprises.

**Please note**:\
Refunds are not issued unless required by law. Instead, any remaining credit from your current plan is applied to your new subscription making the transition smooth and cost-effective.

Choose a plan that matches your blogging goals from trying HyperBlog for free, to scaling content with AI. Plan upgrades and downgrades are smooth, and soon you'll be able to track AI credit usage directly from your dashboard.
