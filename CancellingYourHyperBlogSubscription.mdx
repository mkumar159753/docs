---

HyperBlog offers a no-lock-in policy, you're free to cancel your subscription at any time.

## How to Cancel

1. Go to your **Dashboard → Settings → Billing**
2. Click on **“Cancel Plan”**
3. Confirm cancellation when prompted

Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle.

## Important Notes

- **No long-term contracts** cancel anytime
- To avoid the next charge, cancel **before your billing cycle renews**
- **Refunds** are only issued if:
  - Required by local law
  - A technical failure on our side prevented platform usage 

  (In such cases, reach out to support [hello@hyperblog.io](mailto:hello@hyperblog.io))

## After Cancellation

You can still **export your content** from HyperBlog:

- Go to **Settings → Export**
- Download your blog data for backup or migration to another platform

You’ll retain access to the export feature until your subscription period ends.
